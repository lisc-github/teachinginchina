        <p>As long as you are a Native English Speaker,you have the opportunity to get a good job of teaching English in China.At present,international teachers from native English-speaking countries are still far from enough to meet domestic demand for all types of schools.The largest demand for international teachers is the universities and various types of language training institute.And also the demand of primary and secondary schools even kindergartens is constantly growing.</p>
        <p>Some schools are often worried about not attracting a eligible English speaker,because of the new semester has begun.Therefore they have to continue the recruitment after the semester starts,which resulted in that schools need foreign teachers all year around.</p>

                            <div>If you have opportunity to visit colleges, you will definitely love to teach there. In china, most of Universities have beautiful and natural scenery together with the ancient style of buildings, it forms an old-timely beautiful, peaceful and pleasant campus. It is an ideal place for bringing up thousands of scholars and future Elites.</div>
                            <div>Some universities are located in urban area, while others are in the outskirt of the city. However, no matter where the location it is, the convenience of people's life is ensured. There are post office, bank, and shopping market around the University. If the campus is far away from the downtown, the university will also arrange shuttle bus for teachers.</div>
                            <div>Most of Universities are well experienced in hosting foreign teachers and will make great effort to assist you in settling in. As long as you keep an open mind, stay as flexible as possible and set out to enjoy your stay, you should have a good time of your life. On many campuses, there are exclusive dining halls for foreign teachers where provide various west food and exclusive apartment for foreigners, which are well-equipped with all facilities, such as bedrooms, bathrooms, kitchens and so on.</div>
                            <div>Since almost every student in university has learned English for more than 6 or 7 years, the majority of students know English. As a result, it is easy for foreigners to communicate with them. Only if you are easy-going and be willing to make friends with teachers and students there, they would be glad to be your friends. Chinese people are noted for their hospitality, so if you meet any problem in you daily life you can share troubles with them, they will definitely help you out. Several weeks later, you will find you have totally involved in the local life.</div>
                            <div>Furthermore, since the relatively less teaching hours you will be more relaxed and have more leisure time in the university. Generally speaking, there are only around 16 class hours for teaching English at colleges. If you are asked to teach students majored in English, the courses may be oral English, Listening, Culture, Writing, and etc. But If you are asked to teach students of other majors, the courses you will teach may be only oral English. Except for the time to give classes and prepare for work, teachers will have more spare time to do their personal things everyday. What's more, you can visit local places of interest or scenic spot with your friends at weekends.</div>
                            <div>Another feature of teaching in university is the relatively lower salary. The monthly salary is very different from areas to areas, which will be about RMB 3500 to RMB 5500. In the northern part of China, because of the lagging economy, the salary may be as low as RMB 3500, but the monthly living expenses are much lesser than in the southeast coastal area, 1000 yuan is usually enough to cover your basic expenses. So You can also live a comfortable life there.</div>
                            <div>Except for the monthly salary, there is some compensation for foreign teachers in most universities. If you commit to one year of teaching, most schools will reimburse a round-trip ticket and most schools will pay half of a return ticket upon completion of a six-month contract. Besides that, most foreign teachers will receive some travel allowance or benefit form holiday with salary.</div>

                            <div>Teaching in secondary schools was characterized by more teaching hours but less time for their own.Usually each class lasts for 45 minutes and every teacher needs to teach about 20 hours a week.The number of students in each class is more or less 40-50.It may be a challenge to teach such a big class for those international teachers who is used to teaching small classes.</div>
                            <div>In general,the pay for foreign teachers is not very high in public secondary schools,about 5000 or so.While some private schools will pay more,the monthly salary is about 6000-10000.Most schools will offer free accommodation and subsidies for international air tickets.If the international teachers are not satisfied with free accommodation,they will be allowed to rent an apartment near the school,and bear the rent.Usually every school has a canteen,if international teachers are not accustomed to eat at the school canteens,they can cook meals in their apartment.</div>

                            <div>In addition,the teaching tool that schools can provide is relatively simple.Generally there is a blackboard,chalks,and a display screen and a computer.Thus,teachers need a very rich imagination and creativity to fully mobilize children's interest in learning English.</div>
                            <div>The primary school is the stage of compulsory education and the funding of public primary school is from the state's financial sector funding.Because of financial reasons,the wages of international teachers are not very high,about 4000-5000 or so.However,in some private primary schools,the income of international teachers is relatively high,around 6000-8000 or so.But private schools have a higher demand for the teaching quality of international teachers.They often do some assessment and evaluation of the teaching effects.If the international teacher's teaching does not meet the requirements,he has the risk of being dismissed.</div>
