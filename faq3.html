            <h2>What are the apartments like in the school?</h2>
            <p>Most teachers have their own apartment with necessary working and living conditions: bed, furniture, fully equiped kitchen, washing machine, refrigerator, hot shower, TV, , telephone, in some cases computer with Internet access, etc.), though in some cases you will have to share accommodation with another foreign teacher.</p>
            <h2>Do teachers have a Chinese teaching assistant?</h2>
            <p>Things vary from school to school. The rule of thumb is that the older the student, the less likely you will be provided with a teaching assistant. Private schools and kindergardens will in most cases, however, assign a T.A. to help you teach, translate and maintain order.</p>
            <h2>What available resources are offered to the foreign teacher by their schools?</h2>
            <p>Most of our contact schools supply every teacher with textbooks. Moreover, in some schools you will find a cassette player, overhead projector, computer and a projector. Normally, the head office also has computers, with internet access. It is therefore important that you have a creative imagination and use any available teaching resource to your disposal.</p>
